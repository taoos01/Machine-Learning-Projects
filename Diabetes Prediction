This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately detect the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on diagnostic health parameters. It leverages the Pima Indians Diabetes Datasetâ€”a widely used dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Objective:
To classify whether a patient has diabetes (binary outcome: 0 or 1) using features such as:
-> Number of pregnancies
-> Glucose level
-> Blood pressure
-> Skin thickness
-> Insulin level
-> Body mass index (BMI)
-> Diabetes pedigree function
-> Age
